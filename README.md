# Stock-Analysis

Analysing the Stocks Prices of IBM, Coca-Cola, P&G, Boeing Over the Last 40 years to find trends.I will also see how each company was affected by stock market crashes.


**Insights**<br />
1.Analyzing the IBM stocks over the last 40 years we see that IBM stocksprices have historically been
higher than between January and March.The prices are also at their lowest between September- November.

Thus it makes sense to buy IBM stocks during October and sell them around February.




*Warning*: I have not yet accounted for good or bad years which could skew the average to show a trend that is not really there.
